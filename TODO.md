## ‚úÖ Recently Completed (September 2025)
- [x] **CHECK CONFIGURATION SYSTEM**: Added configuration dialog for field checking
  - [x] Created `CheckConfigDialog` with checkbox options for checking behavior
  - [x] Option 1: Auto-fill missing fields with default values (no user prompts)
  - [x] Option 2: Skip prompts for fields that already match default values  
  - [x] Updated `start_checks_3ded()` and `start_checks_hp()` to use configuration
  - [x] Created `check_line_with_config()` method to respect configuration settings
  - [x] Dialog appears before starting any checks, can be cancelled to abort

- [x] **CRITICAL BUG FIX: CIF Loop Structure Preservation**
  - [x] Fixed major bug where CIF loop structures were corrupted during reformatting
  - [x] Added `CIFLoop` class to properly represent loop structures
  - [x] Updated `CIFParser` to detect and parse `loop_` blocks correctly
  - [x] Implemented `_parse_loop()` method for proper tabular data parsing
  - [x] Added `_format_loop()` method to preserve loop structure in output
  - [x] Fixed issue where loop data was incorrectly converted to semicolon-delimited format
  - [x] Loop structures now maintain proper tabular format with space-separated values
  - [x] Proper handling of quoted values within loop data rows

## üîÑ Current Priority Items

### Field Definitions Modernization
- [ ] **Update field definitions to 2025 CIF Core Dictionary standards**

  - [ ] Update `field_definitions.cif_ed` to use modern CIF standards
  - [ ] Update `field_definitions.cif_hp` to use modern CIF standards
  - [ ] Review and update `field_definitions_all.cif_defs` (contains many deprecated fields)
  
### Missing Modern Electron Diffraction Fields
- [ ] **Add new 2025 CIF core fields for electron diffraction:**
  - [ ] `_diffrn.flux_density` (electron flux in e/√Ö¬≤/s)
  - [ ] `_diffrn.total_dose` (total electron dose in MGy)
  - [ ] `_diffrn.total_dose_su` (standard uncertainty)
  - [ ] `_diffrn.total_exposure_time` (total exposure time in minutes)
  - [ ] `_diffrn.precession_semi_angle` (for precession electron diffraction)
  - [ ] `_diffrn.precession_semi_angle_su` (standard uncertainty)
  - [ ] `_diffrn_source.ed_diffracting_area_selection` (SAED vs probe selection)
