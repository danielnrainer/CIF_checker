Simple CIF (crystallographic information file) viewer/editor, intended to be used mainly for 3D ED CIF files to check for missing/erroneous fields before publishing/depositing the CIF in a paper/database.

The CIF fields to check are declared in a config file 'field_definitions.cif_ed'. This is easily expandable to other use-cases such as high-pressure crystallography, using anther config file 'field_definitions.cif_hp'
